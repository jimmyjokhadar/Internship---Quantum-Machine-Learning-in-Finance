# Internship---Quantum-Machine-Learning-in-Finance
This repository is dedicated for final codes of my internship. This internship was done in order to obtain my master degree in Nanosciences and Functional Materials at the Lebanese University - Faculty of Science. 
The main purpose of this internship was to use the quantum K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm in order to detect credit card fraud based on the distance between the usual location of a client and the location of the ATM used.
